# SeniorJavaProject

This is the code I developed for my Senior Java Project.
Inside of AvailabilityDemand.java there is a main function that is commented out along with test cases inside of it.

This is a short example of my java capabilities.

Comments for this project were forbidden from inside of the code.
Comments were instead written inside of a class diagram.

You will also find a Class Diagram.asta file.
Inside of this file you can view many different diagrams along with all of the comments for the program.

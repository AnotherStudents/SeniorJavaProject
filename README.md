# SeniorJavaProject

This is the code I devloped for my Senior Java Projet.
Inside of AvailabilityDemand.java there is a main function that is commented out along with test cases inside of it.

This is a short exmaple of my java capabilties.

Comments for this project were forbidden from inside of the code.
Comments were instead written inside of a class diagram.

You will also find a Class Diagram.astah file.
Inside of this file you can view many different digrams along with all of the comments for the program.
